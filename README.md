# Suggestion-Armor-Tool-Recycler
Hi! I saw that I had extra armor I didn't need and thought that a way of recycling this armor would be great. For example, a chestplate requires 8 iron ingots to craft. If you use the Recycler with that iron armor it'll give you your ingots back. However, if the armor/tool is slightly damaged, the recycler will only give you a certain amount of ingots back depending on what the durability is. So for an iron chestplate you would divide the total amount of durability a new iron chestplate has (240,) by the amount of ingots used in making it. Since the answer is 30, every 30 durability lost equals 1 less iron ingot when using the Recycler. Not sure if this is too OP or just unessecary, but I thought I'd suggest it anyways. :)
